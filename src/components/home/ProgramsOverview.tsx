    longDescription: "Our low-cost clinics represent the cornerstone of Akomapa&apos;s approach to healthcare delivery. Under the careful supervision of licensed faculty from local institutions, health professional students from diverse backgrounds‚Äîmedical, nursing, pharmacy, optometry, and allied health‚Äîcome together to lead weekend clinics that are truly interprofessional, completely free, and strategically based within communities to maximize access to essential non-communicable disease (NCD) services. These clinics operate on a rotating schedule, ensuring consistent care while providing students with hands-on clinical experience in a real-world setting. The interprofessional model allows for comprehensive patient care, where each student contributes their unique expertise while learning to work as part of a cohesive healthcare team. This approach not only addresses immediate healthcare needs but also builds the foundation for sustainable, community-based healthcare solutions.",
